## 🔄 Recent Changes (2026-02-12)

### AI Opponent for Single-Player
1. **Added AI opponent** - Play against computer with 3 difficulty levels
   - **Easy**: Makes mistakes, only safe attacks, slower reaction
   - **Medium**: Balanced gameplay, occasional suboptimal plays
   - **Hard**: Optimal decisions, aggressive tactics, values trades
   - AI plays all phases: Deploy, Movement, Combat, Titan abilities
   - Visual "AI is thinking..." indicator with spinner animation
   - AI auto-dismisses turn overlay for smooth flow

### 10 UI/UX Improvements + Test Suite
1. **Card text readability:** Increased font size 8px→10px, better contrast (#e0e0e0)
2. **Focus indicators:** Added :focus-visible styles for keyboard navigation (WCAG)
3. **Turn overlay auto-dismiss:** 5-second countdown with progress bar
4. **Unplayable cards:** Grayscale filter, not-allowed cursor, strikethrough cost
5. **HP bar text:** Improved contrast with text-shadow, min-width fix
6. **Energy display:** Crystal icon + current/max format (⚡ 8/10)
7. **Victory celebration:** Confetti particles, flash effect, bounce animation
8. **Turn indicator CSS:** Moved from inline styles to CSS classes
9. **Log empty state:** "Combat log will appear here..." placeholder
10. **Deploy display layout:** Fixed layout shift with min-width

**Additional:**
- Added prefers-reduced-motion support for accessibility
- Created comprehensive test suite with 41 tests
- Added UI/UX audit document (`docs/UI_UX_AUDIT.md`)

### Critical Bug Fix - Turn Switching
11. **Fixed Turn Flow Bug:** When ending turn, the next player's turn now starts correctly
    - **Root Cause:** `dismissTurnOverlay()` only hid the overlay but never called `runPhase()`
    - **Impact:** Player 2 (and subsequent turns) never progressed through phases
    - **Fix:** `dismissTurnOverlay()` now calls `engine.runPhase()` to properly start the new turn
